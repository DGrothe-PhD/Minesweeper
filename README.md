# Gameplay

By default, all tiles are closed. A number of mines will be randomly distrubted across the tiles. 

The Objective of the game is to open all tiles (excluding flagged tiles) without opening a mine. 

If you suspect a tile has a mine, you can "flag" the tile using right click. This will highlight the tile in yellow. 

You can flag as many tiles as you want. 

You can open a tile using left click, however if you open a mine, the game is over, and all mines will be revealed.
