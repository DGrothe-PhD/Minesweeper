# Development Roadmap
### Current focus
Refactoring the logic to extract core gameplay related functionality to seperate concerns into pure functions

### Next step: 
Add Unit Tests

### Further steps
See full [roadmap](https://github.com/v-gajjar/React-Minesweeper/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/v-gajjar/React-Minesweeper.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd React-Minesweeper
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
## Docker Image

```
docker build -t react-minesweeper:v1 .
```

## Run Docker Image

```
docker run -itd -p 8083:80 --name minesweeper react-minesweeper:v1
```

## Accessing on browser (Docker)

The above docker run command maps port 80 of docker container to port 8083 of the host. The host port can be changed as per the user's need. The application will be accessible on browser at http://localhost:8083 in the above case.

# Gameplay

- By default, all cells are closed. A number of mines will be randomly distributed across the cells. 

- The objective of the game is to open all cells that don't contain a mine.

- If you suspect a cell has a mine, you can "flag" the cell using right click. This will display a flag on the cell. 

- You can flag as many cells as you want. 

- You can open a cell using left click, however if you open a mine, the game is over.
  
- If you lose the game, incorrectly placed flags will be replaced with a cross, correctly placed flags will remain, and mines hidden in any other cells will be revealed. 

- The number on a cell is the number of mines hidden within the 8 cells that surround it. 

- To make the game fairer, mines will not be distrubuted until the first left-click and won't be placed on the first cell that you open. 

## Game Difficulty Settings

There are currently three difficulty settings
| level | board size | number of mines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| easy | 9 rows by 9 columns | 10
| medium | 16 rows by 16 columns | 40
| hard | 16 rows by 30 columns | 80
