# Gameplay

By default, all tiles are closed. A number of mines will be randomly distributed across the tiles. 

The objective of the game is to open all tiles that don't contain a mine.

If you suspect a tile has a mine, you can "flag" the tile using right click. This will display a flag on the tile. 

You can flag as many tiles as you want. 

You can open a tile using left click, however if you open a mine, the game is over, and all mines will be revealed.
