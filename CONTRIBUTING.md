# Contributing Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! Thank you for considering making a contribution to the project. A variety of contributions so far have really helped to improve the project, and yours could too!

## Guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to ensure everyone is using the same process to help improve the project.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

A variety of contributions are welcome! People have reported bugs, suggested features to improve the project, helped with testing, reviewed and fixed broken PRs, worked on CI/CD pipelines, and made improvements to performance, styling, and documentation.

## What Contributions Are Not Needed (Currently)

We are currently not looking for any more contributions to the UI mock-ups, but this may change in the future.

## Ground Rules

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Creating an Issue – To Report Bugs or Suggest Features/Enhancements

Before creating an issue, please first check the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/v-gajjar/projects/2) to see whether a ticket already exists — this helps avoid duplicates and keeps the project organized.

If you don't find a matching issue, feel free to create one using the appropriate issue template.  
Please follow the relevant template rather than submitting in an arbitrary format.

Once created, your ticket will automatically appear in the **“Under Consideration”** column of the project's Kanban board.

## Choosing an Existing Issue

If you'd like to contribute to an existing issue, check the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/v-gajjar/projects/2) for tickets in the **TODO** column that aren’t already assigned.

We’d especially appreciate help on tasks labelled  
[`priority:high`](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22priority%3A%20high%22) or  
[`priority:medium`](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Apriority%3Amedium),  
as these are currently the most impactful for the project.

If you're unsure whether a ticket is available or appropriate to work on, feel free to comment on the issue to ask!

## Submitting a PR

Before submitting, link your PR to its related issue.  
If one doesn’t exist yet, please create it first — this helps with tracking and discussion.

**Note:** We all sometimes forget! Creating and linking an issue afterward is totally fine — thank you for doing it.

### Branching Strategy (Git Flow)

- Please branch off the `develop` branch (not `main`).
- Make sure your local `develop` branch is up to date before branching off.
- PRs should be submitted against the `develop` branch unless otherwise discussed.
