# Contributing Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! Thank you for considering making a contribution to the project. A variety of contributions so far have really helped to improve the project, and yours could too!

## Guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to ensure everyone is using the same process to help improve the project.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

A variety of contributions are welcome! People have reported bugs, suggested features to improve the project, helped with testing, reviewed and fixed broken PRs, worked on CI/CD pipelines, and made improvements to performance, styling, and documentation.

## What Contributions Are Not Needed (Currently)

We are currently not looking for any more contributions to the UI mock-ups, but this may change in the future.

## Ground Rules

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Creating an Issue – To Report Bugs or Make Suggestions for Features/Enhancements

Before creating an issue, we would appreciate it if you could first check the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/v-gajjar/projects/2) to see whether there is already a ticket for the issue – this helps avoid duplicate issues and is in the best interests of the project.

If you don't see an issue, feel free to create one using any of the provided issue templates. Please follow the relevant template rather than creating an issue in an arbitrary format.

Once a ticket is created, it will be automatically added to the "Under Consideration" column of the project's Kanban board.

## Choosing an Existing Issue

If you're interested in contributing to an existing issue, please check the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/v-gajjar/projects/2) for tickets in the **TODO** column that aren’t already assigned.

We would appreciate it if you could choose a task labelled **`priority:high`** or **`priority:medium`**, as these are currently the most impactful for the project.

If you're unsure whether a ticket is available or appropriate to work on, feel free to comment on the issue to ask!

## Submitting a PR

Before submitting a PR, again, we would appreciate it if you could check whether there is already a related issue. If there isn’t, feel free to go ahead and create one, then link the issue to the PR.

**Note:** We're all human. We all have those moments where you end up creating a PR without first checking for an issue or creating one if necessary – if you can create an issue and link it to the PR, that will be highly appreciated.

### Branching Strategy (Git Flow)

- Please branch off the `develop` branch (not `main`).
- Make sure your local `develop` branch is up to date before branching off.
- PRs should be submitted against the `develop` branch unless otherwise discussed.
