# Contributing Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! Thank you for considering making a contribution to the project. A variety of contributions so far have really helped to improve the project, and yours could too!

## Guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to ensure everyone is using the same process to help improve the project.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

A variety of contributions are welcome! People have reported bugs, suggested features to improve the project, helped with testing, reviewed and fixed broken PRs, worked on CI/CD pipelines, and made improvements to performance, styling, and documentation.

## What Contributions Are Not Needed (Currently)

We are currently not looking for any more contributions to the UI mock-ups, but this may change in the future.

## Ground Rules

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Working with Issues

Before creating or selecting an issue, please check the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/v-gajjar/projects/2) to see whether a ticket already exists.  
This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the project organized.

- **To report a bug or suggest a feature:**  
  If no issue exists, create one using the relevant issue template. It will be automatically added to the **“Under Consideration”** column.

- **To pick up an existing task:**  
  Look for tickets in the **TODO** column that aren’t already assigned.  
  Priority tags ([`priority:high`](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22priority%3A%20high%22), [`priority:medium`](https://github.com/v-gajjar/Minesweeper/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Apriority%3Amedium)) indicate the most impactful work.

If you’re unsure whether something is available or appropriate to work on, just leave a comment on the issue to ask!

## Submitting a PR

Before submitting, link your PR to its related issue.  
If one doesn’t exist yet, please create it first — this helps with tracking and discussion.

**Note:** We all sometimes forget! Creating and linking an issue afterward is totally fine — thank you for doing it.

### Branching Strategy (Git Flow)

- Please branch off the `develop` branch (not `main`).
- Make sure your local `develop` branch is up to date before branching off.
- PRs should be submitted against the `develop` branch unless otherwise discussed.
